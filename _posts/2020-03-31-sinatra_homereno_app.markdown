This module was a challenging one for me. Before I started at Flatiron, I had plans to move my family accross the country and that definitely took a toll on my Sinatra assignmentsâ€”but once the we settled into our new city, my focus was catch up. So here's what I learned...

Working with databases in Sinatra is seamless when compared to working with raw SQL queries (I don't like writing SQL). It took me some time to get used to the file structure, organizing everything under an "app" directory, and then separating your model, view, and controllers. I truly enjoyed seeing how the backend begins to communicate with the fron-end. Overall, the Sinatra module was enjoyable.

I built an app that keeps track of a user's home renovation projects. The user can create an account, login and start creating tasks with full CRUD functionality. I am definitly going to continue building on this project, but for now, it works.
